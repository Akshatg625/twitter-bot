<h1>Exploring GPT-2</h1>
We fine-tuned the GPT-2 language model (345 and 124 million parameters) on quotes,shakespeare text to create AI versions of them.
###(Yet to DO)and then had the bots rewrite real tweets or complete tweets based on various prompts (short sentence starters like “The meaning of life is”).

Some of these are funny, some are profound, some are dark in a way that make us pause for a second.

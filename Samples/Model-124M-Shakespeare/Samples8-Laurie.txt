====================
Laurie, you have a word with me
    And I'll confess to bed with you.
    But, good my wife, how shall we end this night?
    I'll tell you how you do adore me;
    And with that my love shall end this night.
                                  
====================
Laurie, my lord.
    But, for your honour, I pray you take no more interest.
    I will not take no interest in you.
  GARDINER. No, my good lord; I will not take no interest in you.
    I am very sorry that a friend should lack honour.
    But, good my lord, now you are gone, you are gone;
    And I will have some

Laurie, our daughter, our son,
    Came in the presence of the King,
    And, hearing my lordship was in readiness,
    Came to the King's presence, and, hearing my lord
    Was distraught, swore, and did shake his head,
    Turning to his mother, and saying, 'Go, my daughter,
    To seek the King's person.'
    And then he

====================
Laurie. Here comes your husband,
    Who loves you with a kindest love,
    Committing you to his gracious touch,
    Such a kind and such a spirit of love,
    That you may say you know him,
    And think him your husband.
    It is the third hour of day,
    And no man but you may see it;
    For that's past
====================
Laurie,
    Where God shall play a gentle part in your death,
    I fear, and yet I fear not my death.
  SALISBURY. I never could be so sure
    I'd have a friend to save my life.
  KING HENRY. O, pardon me, royal cousin,
    But what means this?
  SALISBURY. He that hath beaten his horse,
   
====================
Laurie, come with me;
                                                     [They walk away.]

                                       Enter Amazons.

    O Amazons, art thou gone?
                  Give me your hand.
   
====================
Laurie, to thee, and all thy followers,
    That stand in thy way.
                                                         [Gives her a paper.]
                
====================
Laurie, what say you to that?
    Why doth he flatter himself at the crown,
    And, for the breaks of day, is his crown
    No more than an ill-dealing fellow?
    O, he doth not flatter himself at the crown!
    For he's a man of letters, and for the crown
    Shall not flatter himself at the crown.

====================
Laurie,
    What's the matter?

                              Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. Dear Sir,
    If your Majesty was not a Briton,
    You should have known it from me.
  KING. So do I, my liege.
  MESSENGER.
====================
Laurie, my lord! Maid,
    Look on the day of day.
    My lord, that young knave, sir, is gone to bed.
    Come, let me see who is here by himself.
    I'll tell you who he is, and how he is come;
    And when he is gone, let me see you all.
              
====================
Laurie, uncle, in the church,
    And with the flower of his soul still dwells.
    Ah, how it comforts me to see a lady so young!
    Ah, how my joys are inform'd by her!
    How happy I see a wife, and how full of joy
    She hath in me! My old lady, and my dear friend!
    I would be buried with her

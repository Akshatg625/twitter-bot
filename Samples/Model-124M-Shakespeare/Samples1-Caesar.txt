Caesar's wife; by whom,
    And what is the news with him?
    I was with him last night; he had been with me,
    And not seen me since.
  CORIOLANUS. Nay, he is gone, I warrant you;
    And I am glad to see him return.  
    Hot shall he be, and hot shall he be!
    Let me see
====================
Caesar was an honest man,
    And ever in good time bearing his side.
    The devil forbid that his lady should have his love.
    A bawd, a camel, a calf, a babe-
    A dame, a bawd, a camel, a cow-
    A dame, a camel, a cow-  
    A bawd, a camel, a camel
====================
Caesar's army
    At Pomona, the pilgrimage-place,
    Upon the sacred hill of Ithaca.
  FALSTAFF. Come, come, and see the Count.
  CASSIUS. My lord, I have been going to Rome since the king
    was made king.
  FIRST CITIZEN. On the feast, and then to Rome.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Go,
====================
Caesar. The King of Naples,
    That hath been the subject of my studies,
    Is grown jealous of my love;
    And, like a gallant, he hath desire to kill me.
    But, Hector, be that thou think'st of me not;
    For that thou art a subject to my spleen,
    And the King of Naples is a subject to my death.
  
====================
Caesar's army spread
    And cried 'Give us some men!' "
    And this was he:
    'Give us some men! No more.'

  AARON. Let us see,
    And see what confusion is in his speech.
    This was Caesar's saying, and he swore it.
    But how came he so publicly sworn?
    Why did he swear so publicly?

====================
Caesar

SCENE IV.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CLEOPATRA, and ANTONY

  CLEOPATRA. How now, my Queen? What news with you?
  ANTONY. Not a word.
====================
Caesar's death
    Shall make the world more prosperous
    Than I have seen before. By his hand I'll set up my state,
    And make this answer: Caesar's death
    Shall make the world more prosperous.
    So shall you see what he means by the death
    of Caesar.
  TITINIUS. I am glad of Caesar's death, and do desire you
    To
====================
Caesar. I cannot follow thee like a phoenix.
    I'll follow thee like a coward.
    Men are made by their strengths, and strength is made by
    strength. I cannot follow thee like a coward.
    Men are made by their virtues; they are made by their qualities.
    Men are made by their eyes; they are made by their gait; they are made
    by their voice;
====================
Caesar's death
    Was a most sudden, and a salutary event
    That did counterween all things.
  PORTIA. All things, my lord, that I know, that have been well
    Pluck'd out of the way of my death;
    The general's body, the soldiers, and all,
    All brought forth by the gods, with all the rest
    That were not
====================
Caesar. A good Caesar! O,
    Good Caesar, be not content to be so!
    I am happy to see thee alive,
    And will not be so long afeard.
  TROILUS. I will be so, and have the wisdoms of
    Myself; and what I shall do, my pleasure will
    Be nothing but your own.
  SEBASTIAN. If thou
====================
Caesar is more than caught,
    That much of his wealth is spent on the Senate.
    But what is Caesar's wealth?
    He that goes barefoot in his legions,
    And no battles but those which he hath lost,
    Is nothing like Caesar.
  BERTRAM. What is that?
  CLEOPATRA. The commonwealth of Rome, as it is,
    Is
====================
Caesar's triumph
    Is not worth the trial of all the while.
    O, take this opportunity for my love,
    If ever there's such a man of breath as Caesar;
    And that he were not an enemy to Caesar,
    I would not have known his life's end.
  FIRST CITIZEN. O gracious Emperor,
    You have not only made me rich, but I have
====================
Caesar's triumph is not in our eyes.
    We are as the sun, as the moon, and the earth
    As if a comet were out of the clouds
    With his beams of light burning in our face,
    Like a new-made lamb that is not seen.
    Let us, the gods, and the universal powers,
    Unspool our hopes into our heads.
    [
====================
Caesar's Caesar; and his sons
    Caesar, the Dauphin, and his sons, the Pharsicians,
    That were the bulwarks of the flood
    When Caesar was Emperor.
  SEBASTIAN. There's nothing but a dream about their birth:
    The Poisons of Caesar are too weak to carry
    Their infection.
  ARVIRAGUS. And one of the Dau
====================
Caesar
  LUCILIUS. But who comes here?
    What is the time?
  ARVIRAGUS. I am at the close of dinner.
    What, is he gone?

                         Enter a SERVANT

    Good morrow, sir.
  SERVANT. Good morrow, dinner is ready.

Romeo, a. Brabant, a.
                      Pray you, tell me:
    What is thy name, and what is thy fortune?
    If thou art well, thou shalt have a daughter.
    [Aside] Thou art a goodly man, but young; thou art old.
    O, let me see thy face
====================
Romeo

Enter Antony and Cassius.

                                    Enter Cassius.

                                                  
====================
Romeo
  Rom. And whither we shall go.
  Leon. I'll tell him, and he'll tell me.                              Exit
  Leon. Now, my noble lord, a word.
  Rom. 'Tis pity of his death.
  Leon. 'Tis pity of his death.
  Rom. O Lord,
====================
Romeo, thou art my father,
    And thou art the husband of the King.
  ORLEANS. Let this be so, madam.
    Were he my husband, my father should be
    A king that should be mine only heir.

                           Enter the KING OF FRANCE

  KING.  [Aside]
====================
Romeo, for myself, to thee.
  MARCUS. O, I can, and shall, and will, and will!
  PANDULPH. And shall! O, what a thing was this!
  AARON. Of all kinds!
  PANDULPH. And all sorts of figures! Some of them, but not all,
    Were fathers of my love; some of them, but not all,
    Were very
====================
Romeo, do not fear me.
  Rom. No, my lord.  
  Rom. I am afraid of you.
  Rom. I am afraid of you too.
  Rom. I am afraid of you, my lord.
  Rom. I am an old fool of your opinion.
  Rom. I am afraid of you too.
  Rom. I am afraid of you too.
  Rom. I am an old fool of my opinion.

====================
Romeo, my lord,
    The sun sets and the moon sets; and before him
    A sea of fountains, the tidings of the world,
    Unfold'd, unsearchable, and not known by
    The senses in their faculties.
    But what shall we do with our lives, our lives
    That make us less than we appear?
  LEONTES. My lord,

====================
Romeo is dead.
  Portia. By the hand of nature, thou art dead.
    Thy son had a son (O Tim. a son?),
    Who, reputed dead, would be come back again.
    The sea, like a merchant, would be thaw'd,
    And Adam's garden shut the floodgates.
    O, thou art not dead.
  Portia. O, stop
====================
Romeo. The Lord
    Go to his Majesty; and, my good friends,
    Upon my knee I take the cause of my love
    To hear from him.
  MENENIUS. The right of Rome
    Is at hand. It is this which you call to heart:
    A slave-trading Rome, which, as it were,
    Is not cut off with a hand. Who is
====================
Romeo's wife.
    The King was a Christian, a true one.
    I was not martyred; there was none in Rome.
    Were not you martyred?
  Rom. No, but I lost my life for my country.
    But were you martyred?
  Rom. No, but I was martyred for my country.
    But were you martyred?
 
====================
Romeo,
    Thou, and thy brothers, shall be the very monument
    To thy high-storm fortune, that we may feast in peace  
    And mourn with our dear mistress.
                                     [They dance]
    So, so, so, so, so
====================
Romeo.
    I hear you are going to Rome,
    And I am going to ask the Emperor
    What you have done, and what you intend to do
    In Rome.
    Let me see, and I'll be with you.
                                     
====================
Romeo, Pompey, and Cassius,
    Host to the Emperor's party.                                   Exeunt




SCENE III.
The plain before CASSIUS

Enter CASSIUS and AARON

  CASSIUS. The poor Cassius, that hath so much comfort from
====================
Romeo. Though the hand of death claps on the heart of life, yet the hand of life
    shows thee not mercy,
    Not to be led by the hand of death,
    For to your hands and your hands' hands I leave thee.
    Of what bloody hand?
  PAROLLES. Nothing.
  KATHERINA. There is no hand of death, but hands of death.
  PAROLL
====================
Romeo, thou art a poor man,
    And barren of women's eyes.
    I have no eyes to see you, no heart to love,
    No eye to hear you, no tongue to hear you.
    [To Lucius] O, what a whore is this that comes to me
    With such grace and such promise!
    And yet, O, he's not welcome!
    I

Maximus.
  ANTONY. Madam, what shall be done with him?
  MARCUS. He was once an excellent man, an honest man.
  ANTONY. He was, I think, his man, I think.
  MARCUS. He was, I think, his master, I think.
  ANTONY. He was, I think, his brother.
  MARCUS. A good brother, an honest brother, a

Maximus.
    Thou art my friend, and I hope my issue will prove
    A friend to thee.
    I had rather be a wicked state than a friend,
    If thou shouldst be a friend to me.
    God save my good friends.                               Exeunt




====================
Maximus.  
    We are at the King's, and are now with him.
  PANDULPH.  [Aside]  A good temper, my good friends.
    Pray you, sit down.
    Bid the royal commons sit down and thither.
  CASSIUS. I will sit down.
  CASSIUS. I will, my lord.

                                                                       Exit Mer.
    Lord, I must to your Majesty. 
====================
Maximus.
  ANTONY. Good my lord, take my hand,
    And let me see your Majesty's heart.
    The Emperor must be satisfied that you
    Were not so far from the Empress' love
    As to have taken her by force.
  ANTONY. O, I do not fear her. Exeunt ANTONY and OLIVIA
  OLIVIA. You are right, sir;

Maximus.
  SERVANT. Most worthy sir, the gods forbid.
  SERVANT. O, sir, you are a fool to think so.
  SERVANT. O, sir, 'tis true;
    The gods forbid.
  SERVANT. O, sir, you are a fool to think so;

    But I am blind.
    What art thou, warrior?
    I had thought thou wast a purer warrior,
    Who, like a righteous and valiant ancestor,
    Had made his fortune by fighting with
====================
Maximus,
    That so far we were acquainted, was in Rome.
    I doubt it not. So many of our friends
    Have been there, and so much they know, that
    It is not strange they have been there.
    What's more, if they were, would we not be so afraid
    To have them call'd so?
  BRUTUS. We fear'd the Romans would not

Maximus.
  LYSANDER. Forsooth, I have lived;
    And yet I must pity him.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot do so, for he is wise.
    But had he been a little son of Jupiter,
    He would not have been so hardy as he is.
    He loves good people, and loves not himself.
    He is wise, and loves not

Maximus.
  MARINERS. This is a figure of the play,
    Which shall be played with the best sound
    And best voice.
  TITINIUS. "This is a villain" says he.
  MARINERS. The play is false; the villain is true.
  TITINIUS. "This is a villain" says he.
                
====================
Maximus is alive and well.
  THESEUS. He is; and he hath a good word with Caesar for your life,
    as 'twas he said he would.
  THESEUS. A good word with Caesar!
  THESEUS. No love, no words, no man of him, no Caesar.
  THESEUS. And he, that hath a just cause of life.
  THESEUS. And a life for a man that hath a love for

Maximus. How in the world shall I find out this unnatural ceremony?
  ANTONY. How will I find out this unnatural ceremony?
  ANTONY. A strange thing to do.
    Nay, that you would do it not; for it is a strange thing
    to do it; and it is a strange thing to do it.
    Would you had but made the ceremony of it,
    Had you given me leave

Maximus.
  TRANIO. O, my lord, how heavy the work is!
    What means the general's sickness?
  DOCTOR.  [Aside]  And he will smile at us, and say 'Yes!'
    And say 'No to Rome' rivall'd.  
  TRANIO. O, in good time, my lord, when these tidings come!
    What is the nature of this sickness
====================
Maximus,
    Let him see the whole story, and to-morrow
    Shall be his last.

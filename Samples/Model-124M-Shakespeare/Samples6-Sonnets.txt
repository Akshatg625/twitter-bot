    And that's all, I think, of your letters.
    Your Grace shall send him letters of pardon,
    And to no question answer him.
  HELENA. I am glad to see that you care not for my
    picture.
  DORCAS. My lord, your picture is as true as your

  KING RICHARD. My Lord of Suffolk,
    Why doth the King come hither?
  GLOUCESTER. Not to know you, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Why, what news?
  GLOUCESTER. The King is gone; I speak not to him.

Sonnet,
    The very whichest cheer of my brain
    Should be felt by ewers to shut up.
  KING RICHARD. Nay, but I'll not fear the lion's hide;
    For my mind is full of such things.
    But what of the gold he'll bring home to England?

    And have your charges.
  Fal. But wherefore send we forth?
  Bard. To seek our friends in England.
    We do not revel in boast, nor go about it
    In a mood of great pride; but we do

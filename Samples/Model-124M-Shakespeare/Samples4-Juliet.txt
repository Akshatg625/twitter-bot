====================
Juliet. Away!
    Away, sweet heart; for your woes are deep and

  PROTEUS. In all honesty, you are deceiv'd.
    Those that knew you at the time, and all your friends,
    Do remember now, and are well acquainted

Juliet, the fish-man,
    Receiving letters to my mother's,
    He was a most holy man, and had
    A kind of spirit to out-poison

Juliet. I love you; and I have a son
    To tell you something of. 'Tis strange, hark ye;
    And 'tis a strange tale.

Juliet. There is, by the stars, my lord,
    Thy chiefest wife and most precious-born son,
    Whose sovereign dower is a wonder of thine;
